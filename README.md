# Hangman
Hangman Game Python Project


Similar to guessing the number, except we are guessing the word. The user needs to guess letters,
Give the user no more than 6 attempts for guessing wrong letter. This will mean you will have to have a counter. You can download a ‘sowpods’ dictionary file or csv file to use as a way to get a random word to use.
